  <h2>Who is Captain America ?</h2>
 </div>
  <p>Captain America, also known as Steve Rogers, was once just a small, skinny boy from Brooklyn, New York. After World War II broke out, Steve was eager to enlist in his country's military. After many failed attempts, he was finally accepted. After proving his grit and determination, and generally being a good guy, he was recruited for the super-soldier experiment. Fortunately for him, it succeeded in transforming him into the greatest weapon that would change the course of the war.
    After assisting the allies in destroying numerous Hydra bases, commanded by another super soldier known as Red Skull, he was forced into one last encounter with the villainess Red Skull. In one last attempt to turn the tide of the war, Red Skull was going to attempt to drop nukes on multiple countries. After defeating Red Skull in a courageous battle, he plunged the plane full of nukes into the icy caps of Antarctica.
    After 70 years of being trapped in the ice, the Captain is finally found by some Arctic explorers. Steve starts to work for Nick Fury, whom he had fought with in the war, who is the commander of Shield.</p>
