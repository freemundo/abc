    <p>As a child, Matt Murdock (Daredevil) fell into a vat of chemicals, which blinded him. He later discovered that although it had taken his sight, all his other senses had been heightened to an amazing new level. Matt's father died early in his life, leaving him an orphan in an orphanage, where he focused on his physical abilities and became a master martial artist. After returning from law school, Matt concentrated on crime in Hell's Kitchen and donned the Daredevil suit. His archenemies include Bullseye and the Kingpin. Examples of the adventures Daredevil has had include taking down gangster mobs, fighting for people in court through his law firm, and battling with his on-and-off girlfriend, Elektra Natchios.</p>
