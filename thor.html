    <p>Thor is a beloved Marvel character based on a real Norse god, but where did he come from to meet the heroes of Earth? It all started when Thor was banished from Asgard, stripped of his powers, and sent to Midgard (Earth). When he crashed down to Earth, he was found by human Jane Foster (who eventually took up the title of Thor). Thor, stranded on Earth, began to regain his worthiness. After defeating the destroyer Loki sent to kill him, he regained his worthiness and went to take control of Asgard from Loki. He successfully did this, also saving Yoteandhimn in the process, from Loki (what a weirdo). He later joins the Avengers and the Guardians of the Galaxy, saving more planets.</p>
